The **Personnel Security** module manages the lifecycle of evaluating, granting, monitoring, and enforcing trust-based access for individuals within an organization. It supports formal security reviews, background investigations, adjudication decisions, and the issuance of approved security eligibility levels. The module also enables ongoing oversight through continuous evaluation enrollment and the tracking of reportable events that may impact a person’s access status. Operationally, it manages the issuance and status of access credentials tied to approved eligibility. Typical use cases include initial security vetting, clearance or trust renewals, eligibility upgrades, incident-triggered reviews, foreign travel or contact reporting, continuous monitoring programs, and badge or access credential management across government, defense, critical infrastructure, financial services, healthcare, and other regulated environments.
